# Aion Solo Mining Pool

## About

This is an Aion mining pool designed to be used in conjunction with the Aion mining client to be used on the Aion testnet. This mining pool has been specifically designed to be used only for solo mining on the Aion test network; it is not suitable to be used as a public mining pool and should not be deployed in that configuration.


## Requirements
* **Aion kernel** ([download and install](https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion))
* **Node.js** v8.9.3+ ([download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
* **Redis** key-value store v2.6+ ([download and install](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))
* **Python v2.7**
* **make**
* **node-gyp** v3.6.2+ ([download and install](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp))
* **libsodium** v1.0.16+ ([download and install](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/installation))

## Setup

#### 0) Setting up Aion (Optional)

The default Aion IP and port binding values are 127.0.0.1 (localhost) port 8545. These values may be changed by modify the following lines within the config/config.xml file located within the Aion kernel install folder. The IP and port bindings may be set to desired values; however this guide will assume a default binding of 127.0.0.1:8545.

```
<api>
        <rpc active="true" ip="127.0.0.1" port="8545"></rpc>
        ....
</api>
```

#### 1) Clone the repository locally

```git clone https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_miner.git```

#### 2) Verify the pool has been correctly configured for the Aion RPC connections
- Navigate to the pool_configs folder and open aion.json.
- Scroll to the ```daemons``` section.
- Ensure the daemon configuration matches the Aion IP and port binding from the previous step. 

Eg. Using default settings the configuration should be:

```
    "daemons": [
        {
            "host": "127.0.0.1",
            "port": 8545,
            "user": "",
            "password": ""
        }
    ]
```

#### 3) Compile the Equihash Verifier

- Navigate to ```local_modules/equihashverify```
- Install npm dependencies
```
npm install
```
- Configure node-gyp to build the verifier by running the command: 
```
node-gyp configure
```
The last line out output will say "gyp info okay" if successful. 
- Build the verifier: 
```
node-gyp build
```
The last line out output will say "gyp info okay" if successful.
- Run test with the following command 
```
node test.js
```
- A successful test should output: 
```
Header length: 528
Solution length: 1408
true
8b 57 a7 96 a5 d0 7c b0 
4c c1 61 4d fc 2a cb 3f 
73 ed c7 12 d7 f4 33 61 
9c a3 bb e6 6b b1 5f 49
```

- If the test fails to run attempt to reconfigure to dynamic linker using 
    ```
    sudo ldconfig -v
    ```
    Rebuild the verifier using the command 
    ```
    node-gyp rebuild
    ``` 
    and then repeating the test. 


#### 4) Install remaining modules

- Navigate to the root of the pool directory.
- Run the command 
```
npm install
``` 
and allow all required npm modules to be installed in the node_modules folder.

#### 5) Start Redis Server

- Navigate to the Redis install folder.
- Start the Redis server ```(./src/redis-server)``` from the root of the redis install folder. 

#### 6) Verify Aion configuration
- Open the Aion config in the root Aion folder /config/config.xml.
- Navigate to the consensus section.
- Disable kernel mining (Unless you would like both pool and internal kernal miner).
- Set the miner address to the address which will receive mined block rewards. The address is a 64 character (32 byte) hex string containing the public key and address of an account. 

Eg.

```
<consensus>
        <mining>false</mining>
        <miner-address>4cfb91f3053ee1b87ac5a7a1d9de0f5a14b71b642ae1d872f70794970f09a5a2</miner-address>
        <cpu-mine-threads>8</cpu-mine-threads>
        <extra-data>AION</extra-data>
</consensus>
```

#### 7) Start the Aion kernel

- Navigate to the aion install folder
- Start the kernel ```./aion.sh```

#### 8) Start the mining pool

- Navigate to the base mining pool folder
- Start the mining pool ```./run.sh```
- Ensure the pool starts with no error messages.

At this stage the mining pool is ready to receive client connections and to distribute work. 

#### 9) Validate client connections (Optional)

- The pool is configured to listen for client connections on port 3333 by default. This may be changed in the config.json file located in the root of the pool folder. 
- Connect a client to the pool using a location of **127.0.0.1:3333**. 
- Once connected the client should begin receiving work within several seconds; if receiving work the pool has been successfully configured.
